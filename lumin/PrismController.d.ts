  /**
   * A PrismController represents a section of an application's UI or behavior that is tied to
   * a specific Prism.
   *
   * A single PrismController can be set directly on a Prism (the root prism controller).
   * It will receive event and update loop callbacks for that prism until it is detached or
   * the prism is deleted. Additional PrismControllers can be added to the root controller to
   * create a hierarchy of arbitrary depth. This allows re-usable components like a video player
   * to be added to an application with a single integration point:
   *
   * ```myRootPrismController->addChildController(videoPlayer)```
   *
   * In the example above, PrismController eliminates the need for applications to manually
   * provide the videoPlayer component with onEvent and onUpdate callbacks.
   *
   * When a child controller is added or removed while a prism is already attached, it
   * will receive an onAttachPrism or onDetachPrism callback, respectively, ensuring
   * that the sequence of callbacks a prism controller receive is always:
   *
   * ```
   * - onAttachPrism
   * - onEvent* (any number of calls)
   * - onUpdate* (any number of calls)
   * - onDetachPrism
   * ```
   *
   * Different prism controllers can be attached to the same Prism over time in
   * order to render different scenes within the same prism (e.g. a home navigation
   * scene vs. an application settings scene).
   *
   * A typical sequence of callbacks is shown in the example below:
   *
   * ```
   * controllerA = std::make_shared<MyPrismController>()
   * prism->setPrismController(controllerA)
   * CALLBACK: controllerA->onAttachPrism
   * // --> event from Lumin
   * CALLBACK: controllerA->onEvent
   * ...
   *
   * // Time to show a completely different scene in this prism
   * controllerB = std::make_shared<MyOtherPrismController>()
   * prism->setPrismController(controllerB)
   * // Remove old scene
   * CALLBACK: controllerA->onDetachPrism
   * // Initialize new scene
   * CALLBACK: controllerB->onAttachPrism
   * // --> event from Lumin
   * CALLBACK: controllerB->onEvent
   * ...
   * // Add a video player to the scene
   * videoPlayer = std::make_shared<VideoPlayerController>()
   * controllerB->addChildController(videoPlayer)
   * CALLBACK: videoPlayer->onAttachPrism
   * // --> event from Lumin
   * CALLBACK: videoPlayer->onEvent
   * CALLBACK: controllerB->onEvent
   * // --> prism is deleted (e.g. from secondary UI)
   * // (isPrismDeletePending() returns true during next 2 callbacks)
   * CALLBACK controllerB->onDetachPrism
   * CALLBACK videoPlayer->onDetachPrism
   * ```
