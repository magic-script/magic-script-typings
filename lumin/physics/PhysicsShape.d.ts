   * A shape that can be added to a PhysicsRigidBody. While the PhysicsRigidBody defines how the
   * body moves, due to its mass, PhysicsShapes define the actual shape of the body. PhysicsShapes
   * come in two general types: primitive, and mesh. Primitive shapes are plane, sphere, capsule,
   * and box; they are defined by parameters such as radius and length. Mesh shapes are convex and
   * open; they are defined by mesh data similar to a 3d mesh for rendering.
   *
   * NOTE: mesh shapes are currently not supported.
   *
   * A shape can have one of two behaviors: collision or trigger. A collision shape will collide
   * with other collision shapes and generally act as expected in a physics simulation. A trigger
   * shape does not collide with other shapes. However, if a collision shape enters or exits the
   * bounds of a trigger shape, a PhysicsEventData server event will be generated with a kTriggerEnter
   * or kTriggerExit type. Note a trigger shape interacting with another trigger shape does not
   * generate an event.
   *
   * Multiple shapes can be added to a PhysicsRigidBody. The localPosition and localRotation of the
   * shape sets its position relative to the position of the body.
   *
   * A shape may not be added to or removed from a PhysicsRigidBody once the body has been added to a Prism.
   *
   * A plane or open mesh shape cannot be added to a dynamic PhysicsRigidBody.
   *
   * Note that PhysicsShape have no setters for its data. If you want to modify a shape, you must
   * create a new one.
