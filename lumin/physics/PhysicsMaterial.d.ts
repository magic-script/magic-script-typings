   * Data representing the surface properties of a PhysicsShape. There are 3 values:
   *
   * Static friction : Friction applied to the body if it is not in motion. Most sliding bodies have
   *                   a higher friction when stationary than when moving.
   * Dynamic friction : Friction applied to the body if it is in motion.
   * Restitution : Measure of how much relative energy a body has after a collision. A value of 0
   *               means all energy is lost, 1 means no energy is lost. Can be considered how
   *               "bouncy" a body is.
